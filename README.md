# AtliQ Hotels Data Analysis Project

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. 

Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.

As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. 

However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.


So CSV are provided files for the data. I had to pull those data files into Jupiter Notebook and I had used Pandas which is a very popular module in Python and which helped in exploratory data analysis.


I generated insights by answering the questions asked by the client.


By completing this project,  I have covered various aspects of data analysis projects such as:

Understanding Business Problems

Data Understanding

Data Collection

Data Transformation

Insights Generation
