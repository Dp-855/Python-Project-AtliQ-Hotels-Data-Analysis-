# AtliQ Hotels Data Analysis Project

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. 

Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.

As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. 

However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.


So CSV are provided files for the data. We had to pull those data files into Jupiter Notebook and we used Pandas which is a very popular module in Python and helped us in exploratory data analysis.


We generated insights by answering the questions asked by the client.


By completing this project,  I have covered various aspects of data analysis projects such as:

Understanding Business Problems

Data Understanding

Data Collection

Data Transformation

Insights Generation
